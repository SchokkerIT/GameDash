### Cloudflare

GameDash has full support for Cloudflare's proxy functionality without any loss of functionality. This is a great way to ensure your infrastructure is safe from DDoS attack and the likes by proxying all traffic, hiding the real address of your host. Cloudflare also serves static files to clients via it's CDN, decreasing loading times significantly.

1. Register an account with Cloudflare
2. Follow the setup instructions that Cloudflare provides
3. One your domain is configured, go to the "DNS" tab and create your DNS records. Make sure enable "proxying".

All done! That was simple, wasn't it?
